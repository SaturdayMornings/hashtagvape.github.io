            <h2>Naive Bayes Classification of #cigarette</h2>
            <p>
                In an attempt to quantify #vape, #cigarette, and #ecig tweet content tendencies we used a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether the a given tweet contained #cigarette based on what text the tweets contained. We ran the model twice with 10-fold cross validation each time.

                On Run 1 we fed the model inconsequential attributes and the model was as accurate as we predicted. It randomly assigned hashtags to the tweets. 

                On Run 2 we fed the model those same attributes but included a boolean value that we think serves as a reasonable proxy for tobacco-related health concerns. If the tweet included cancer, kills, quit, or quitting, the boolean would evaluate to 1, otherwise, 0. A t-test revealed that including this value statistically significantly increased the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy.

                Here are the results in more detail:
